SKAMPI Sub-systems
******************

This page briefly describes the various sub-systems integrated within SKAMPI, and
provides useful links to the projects.

SDP (Science Data Processor)
============================

The SDP is the system of the telescope responsible for processing observed data into
required data products, preserving these products, and delivering them to
the SKA Regional Centres.

OET (Observation Execution Tool)
================================

The OET is an application, which provides on-demand Python script
(telescope control script) execution for the SKA.
