	Scenario Outline: when the telescope subarrays can be aborted then abort brings them in ABORTED
		Given operator John has a running telescope with a subarray in state <subarray_obsstate>
		When operator issues the ABORT command
		Then the subarray eventually goes into ABORTED
		
		Examples:
		| subarray_obsstate  | 
		| IDLE               | 
		| READY              | 
		| SCANNING           |
